# Math
#### Efficient Modulos:
	(x * y * z) % m = ((((x % m) * y) % m) * z) % m
#### First multiple of x that is strictly greater than y:
	m = ((x + y) / y) * y
#### Sum of sequence of Integers from 1, 2, 3, ..., n:
	S = (n * (n + 1)) / 2
#### Sum of sequence of Integers from x, x+1, x+2, ..., n:
	S = ((n - x + 1) * (x + n)) / 2
#### Sum of n amount of a[i] = i^2 Squares i.e. 1 + 4 + 9 + 16...
	S = (n*(n+1)*(2n+1)) / 6
#### Sum of n amount of a[i] = i^3 Cubes i.e 1 + 8 + 27 + 64....
	S = |(n * (n + 1)) / 2|^2
#### Fast Ceil when dividing positive Integers x & y:
	c = (x + y - 1) / y
	(c++ floors by default)
#### Quick Even or Odd:
	if (num & 1) //ODD
	if (!(num & 1)) //EVEN
#### Fast Multiplication by 2:
	n = n << 1;
#### Fast division by 2:
	n = n >> 1;

# Problem Solving Methods

### Pre-computation:
	Solving all possible solutions from a1 to an (where n is max possible value)
	This method is slow in the beginning, but is instant on all future tests.

Use of strlen() can be avoided by:
```
for(i = 0; str[i]; i++) {}
```

Instead of `push_back()` in STL, `emplace_back()` can be used because it is much faster. Instead of allocating memory somewhere else and then appending it, it directly allocates memory in the container.
